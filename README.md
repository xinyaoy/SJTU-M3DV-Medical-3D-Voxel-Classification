[ver3.py](https://github.com/xinyaoy/SJTU-M3DV-Medical-3D-Voxel-Classification/blob/master/ver3.py) is the code for training and testing. 
Running it, you can use the given data to train the model and save it. It  will output the result on the test set with csv file. 

[test.py](https://github.com/xinyaoy/SJTU-M3DV-Medical-3D-Voxel-Classification/blob/master/test.py) is the code for loading the model
 saved and getting the result.  Running it, you can use the model that has been trained before and get the result directly.
 
 [model000132](https://github.com/xinyaoy/SJTU-M3DV-Medical-3D-Voxel-Classification/blob/master/model000132) is the model that has been trained.
 The result of it has been saved in the csv file
